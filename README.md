# Wall Stick Shooter Prototype
Prototype for a platformer/shooter game where the player can stick to walls. Made with Unity.
NOTE: This is a game prototype and the code in this project is NOT good practice.

## Prototype 1 - Movement:

Click to travel in a direction. The player sticks to the walls they collide with.

## Prototype 2 - Platforming:

Added 3 enemy types: Stationary, Spinnning and Jumping.
When player is killed, they are respawned at the start of the level.
Reach the end of level to advance in the game.
This prototype contains 1 test level, and another level to test the functionality of the end-of-level object.

## Prototype 3 - Bullet Hell:

Added 3 bullet patterns and 2 obstacles.
Can switch between old and new levels with numerical buttons "1" and "0".
Final prototype to determine whether or not to work on this game.
